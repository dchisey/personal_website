        <h3>Intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Web development is a recent hobby of mine; I've been learning since January 2017. Using this skill, I've not only been able to learn to build a webpage (this one is built from scratch), but I've also created tools to automate business processes. These include an ad creation tool, a content analyzer using natural language processing and automated reporting using AdWords Scripts.</p>
